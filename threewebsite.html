    <h1>Rob's Review of Website's (Two good, one bad)</h1>

    <p>Below are the following websites...</p>

    <h2>1. Good: Nike <a href="https://www.nike.com/">nike.com</a> (Favorite)
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <p>I like this website because I think it is very clean and crisp. I am on this website very often because this is where I go to shop for shoes and athletic clothing. Another reason I choos eot use their website is because while there is a Nike store in Spokane, they never have what I'm looking for when I am in there. Also, it seems like whenever I go to their website to order something, an ad pops up stating "25% off sitewide" and this is somthing you can not easily get inside the store.</p>
        <p>The code is very clean and modern. When I shrink my screen tab, the content within the website shrinks accordingly with the screen. It also minimizes the options for search, cart, and menu at the top of the screen which also stays fixed as I scroll down the page. They use tables towards the bottom of the page for various options consumers can click on for more information. They also have social media icons at the bottom of the page in their footer for people to engage with.

            The layout is very easy to read and the columns shrink accordingly when shrinking the size of the page. The website does have a scrolling effect by having a fixed menu page at the top when scrolling down the page.
        </p>

        <p>
            The website is very easy to navigate when looking for products. I noticed that even if you type something wrong in their search bar, it stills brings you to the page you were looking for. I think this website is done very well and is updated frequently for their new marketing campaigns, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The website colors are pretty generic. They have a simple white background with black fonts. It seems like they use all the same fonts, but in different sizes depending on the content they are presenting. They also have a lot of pictures of athletes with motivational headlines that sit nicely over the page. I think the colors and pictures match their product and service. It is very clean and crisp which is something Nike strives to be.

            I think Nike does a great job with their website. They seem to make sure there is the perfect amount of white space around their content. The colors in the pictures and the shoes contrasts really well to the white background on the page. I really like the overall format of the webpage and they even have suggested items on their home page which attracts consumers to click and interact with.

    <h2>2. Good: Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <p>
            I like the amazon website just because it is one that I am on all the time. They honestly have everything I need and I think this is why they do so well in their industry. One thing that I really like about the Amazon website is the suggested features that correlate to what I usually buy. For example, I was looking to buy some new headlights for my truck, and immediately when I go to their page they already have suggested items that may interest me. I am able to put in the make, model, trim, etc, and they show me the options that will fit. They also do a great job with the pricing and keeping it competitive against others. for example, If I am in need of a product and go to the company's website their price is usually higher than Amazon's and also does not feature 2 day free shipping. I also notice that they show completely random items on their home page that may be of interest to me.
        </p>

        <p>
            The website is very clean and modern, but I noticed that when I shrink my page, their toolbar menu at the top does not shrink accordingly to fit my page. I find this to be really irritating because I have to scroll back and forth to find the tab I am looking for. They are definitely using HTLM5 elements and have simple but clean background images as you scroll down the page. They use tables at the bottom of the page for things like Customer Support, recent orders, your account, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The layout makes sense to me but that may be because I am on the site fairly often. I think the layout would make sense to someone who has never seen their website before, because things ar fairly eady to navigate. They have different sizes and numbers of columns which is cool but does look a little too busy on the home page. I do notice that their toolbar menu at the top of the page is not fixed so it does not stay at the top of my screen when I scroll down the page. This is kindof annoying when I have to scroll to the top of the page in order to find that tab I am looking for.
        </p>

        <p>
            I can navigate arounf the website well just because I am on it often. I think this is done okay, but could use some improvement for someone visiting the page for the first time.

            Amazon uses a few different colors withing their page. They have a simple gray background, but compliment it well with pictures and product descriptions. They also use their company colors so blue, light blue, orange, and white. They use a lot of images and advertisements which show a regular customer their perferred interests. For example, when I go to their home page it shows the recent tv series I have been watching and if I would like to continue watching it. I think they do this really well to keep customers engaged and coming back.

            I think this website (and mainly company) have done a great job with their website. They have a cool clipart photo at the top of their page which includes popcorn, coffee, remote, iPad, and a gaming controller which seems to show a few of the many things that they do. I think this photo really shows that they provide a service/product of entertainment. They seem to be only using a single font family which is essential to keep things looking clean and crisp. The main drawback that I see for their website is how busy the home page is. They have so many different advertisements that is a little overwhelming, but I think they do this on purpose to show the vast majority of things someone can buy on their website.

    <h2>3. Bad: Craigslist <a href="https://spokane.craigslist.org/">spokane.craigslist.org</a>
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <p>
            This Website is one that I go to when I am trying to find something very cheap that will get the job done. For example, this is where I went after I broke my ski pole and needed new ones. I looked at places like REI, but they were way too expensive. So Craigslist is really the website I go to when I am needing something where the value of the product does not matter to me, I just need it to fulfill a need. This website is just so incredibly boring and is not attractive to the human eye at all. While the website is really bad, every once in awhile you can find some very useful things for cheap. I previously tried to sell some ski boots on this website and I had a couple of scammers message me saying they were interested, but they never wanted to talk over the phone. This is another reason why this website is one I try to stay away from when I can.
        </p>

            The code is far from clean and modern, and honestly looks pretty sketchy. They do however use tables in the website which helps it look a little organized and easy to find things, but it really just does not seem like it has anything to offer.
        </p>

        <p>
            The layout does make sense to me, but that is because I have used it quite often in the past. They have very organized columns that are easy to navigate and get around to find products you are looking for. there is no srolling effect and the page does not fit on the screen when you shrink it which makes it hard to navigate things.
        </p>

        <p>
            The colors are very bland and not attractive. They are simply just a generic white and blue color. I don't think the colors match their product at all considering they have a purple peace sign as their logo. This just makes no sense to me and whoever setup this website did not spend much time on making it attractive at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            I do not think this website sets itsef apart from other websites at all. It is very bland and bleak. Maybe their intention was not to create an appealing website since a lot of people go to this site to look for essential things that are very cheap. I also really do not like how when you click on something, it changes the font to a purple color and it stays that way forever. The only attractive thing I see on this website is their formatting of the columns.
